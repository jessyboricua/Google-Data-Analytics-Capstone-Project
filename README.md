# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
This repository contains my Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
In this case study, I perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. Insights gained in this analysis aim to help guide future marketing strategies for the company.
